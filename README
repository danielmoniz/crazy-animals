This project is a recreation the game Botswana (http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/398/botswana). 
It is made with basic HTML and Javascript on the front-end, and PHP (using the Yii framework) on the back-end. 
MySQL is used to save the result of a match.

Note that this game is built off a partially built application. It therefore has files 

It's spec includes:
- ability to play the game online with others
      - all players must log in, guest session or not
- game results saved in database


Possible spec expansions include:
- player rankings (ELO)
- entire games saved (ie. replays possible)

Important directory structure:
- profile-files - self-explanatory. Where all of the code is that users build.
- project-files/protected/config/main.php - The config file that determines URL routing, MySQL information, etc. 
      - for this reason, main.php is not included in the repository. main.sample.php exists as a template. 
      - Feel free to notify me if you believe that main.sample.php is out of date. I will do my best to update it.
- project-files/protected/controllers - The location of the controllers. These call the models for 
      data storage/retrieval, and they call the views to render the game.
- project-files/protected/models - These include classes for object-oriented programming (eg. class Card), 
      as well as functions for storing and retrieving data.
- project-files/protected/views - These render the data sent through a controller. They hold HTML, 
      javascript, and often PHP to aid with any logic required in rendering HTML.
